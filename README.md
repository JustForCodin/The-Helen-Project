# The Helen Project

This is Helen - my cross-platform voice assistan. It's in very early development stage and can be unstable.
There is only English language support. I started my work only week ago. There is no installer
like .deb or .exe or something else. For now it can do very specific, hardly coded stuff.
It recommended to run only on linux. But development doesn't stop and it'll have more features in the future :)


To launch it, just clone this repository to your computer and run:

    python3 helen.py.
    
Warning! For correct work you need to install required models:
  
    pip install gtts, speech_recognition, matplotlib, numpy, scikit-learn

and also:
    
    sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio
    
Good luck! :)
